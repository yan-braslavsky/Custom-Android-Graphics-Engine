# Custom Android Graphics Engine
I implemented a simple node based graphics engine for simple 2d rendering.

### Rendering Features
  - Texture node rendering
  - Scissoring
  - Text rendering (using bitmap fonts)
  - Custom shaders for special effects
  - Custom nodes creation (like circle node)
  
### Animation
Supports tween animations using the Universal  [Tween Engine] [1]

### Input and collision detection
Supports basic rectangle based collision detection.
Supports touch events and their propagation across the nodes.
